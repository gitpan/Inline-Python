Revision history for Perl extension Inline::Python.

0.22  Sun Jan  9 22:29:54 PST 2005
	[Bug reported by David Dyck]
	- removed some declarations after statements
	- newer versions of gcc seem to accept this by default, while older
	  versions just croak. Of course, the older versions also don't
	  support -Wdeclaration-after-statement.

0.21  Mon Jul 26 13:40:57 CDT 2004
	[Patch from Eric Wilhelm]
	- Added support for 'new-style' python classes which subtype builtin
	  types per PEP's 252 and 253.

0.20  Mon Jul  9 16:46:56 PDT 2001
	- Made the Makefile.PL more clever about how it picks debugging 
	  information. It accepts an optional argument, too, so it's
	  easy to correct the mistakes.
