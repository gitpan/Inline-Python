INTRODUCTION:

Inline::Python -- Write Perl subroutines in Python.

Inline::Python lets you write Perl subroutines and classes in
Python. You don't have to use any funky techniques for sharing most
types of data between the two languages, either. Inline::Python comes
with its own data translation service. It converts any Python structures
it knows about into Perl structures, and vice versa. 

Example:

   use Inline Python => <<'END';
   def JAxH(x): 
      return "Just Another %s Hacker" % x
   END

   print JAxH('Inline'), "\n";

When run, this complete program prints:

   Just Another Inline Hacker.

The one line version is:

   perl -le 'use Inline Python=>q{def JAxH(x):return"Just Another %s Hacker"%x};print JAxH+Inline'

INSTALLATION:

This module requires Inline.pm version 0.30 or higher to be installed.

To install Inline::Python do this:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

(On ActivePerl for MSWin32, use nmake instead of make.)

You have to 'make install' before you can run it successfully.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Python and Perl are very different beasts. Perl does "true" dynamic
loading, so if you don't use a package you don't have to load
it. Embedding Python seems to require that you link in all packages
that Python *could* use. I'm not sure why this occurs yet. The
solution I have so far is to look at which libraries Python has built
into it, and include those into your project. This makes loading
Python slower, but does not affect execution speed.

Read the file TESTED and look for a setup similar to yours. The most
likely cause of problems is compile flags being set wrong. You *may*
have to edit Makefile.PL and type in extra compilation flags.
